What's my definition of success? (Of success)
Listening to what your heart says (your heart says)
Standing up for what you know is (is)
Right, while everybody else is (is)
Tucking their tail between their legs (okay)
What's my definition of success? (Of success)
Creating something no one else can (else can)
Being brave enough to dream big (big)
Grindin' when you're told to just quit (quit)
Giving more when you got nothin' left (left)
It's a person that'll take a chance on
Something they were told could never happen
It's a person that can see the bright side through the dark times when there ain't one
It's when someone who ain't never had nothin'
Ain't afraid to walk away from more profit
'Cause they'd rather do somethin' that they really love and take the pay cut
It's a person that would never waver
Or change who they are
Just to try and gain some credibility
So they could feel accepted by a stranger
It's a person that can take the failures in their life and turn them into motivation
It's believing in yourself when no one else does, it's amazing
Yes?
